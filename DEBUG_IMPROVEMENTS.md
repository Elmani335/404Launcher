# 404Launcher Debug Improvements

## Issues Fixed

### 1. JSON Parsing Error - "Unexpected token '<'"
**Problem**: The launcher was intermittently receiving HTML error pages instead of JSON responses from the server, causing `JSON.parse()` to fail with "Unexpected token '<'" errors.

**Solutions Applied**:

1. **Enhanced minecraft-patch.js**:
   - Added global JSON.parse wrapper that detects HTML responses
   - Provides safe fallback objects when HTML is detected
   - Better mock fetch responses for minecraft-java-core

2. **Improved config.js**:
   - Better retry logic with HTML detection
   - Enhanced error logging for debugging
   - Safer fallback instance handling

3. **Enhanced home.js**:
   - Added detailed debugging logs for game launch process
   - JSON.parse wrapper during launch to catch errors
   - Better error handling in all instance fetching methods

4. **Global Error Handlers**:
   - Added uncaught exception and unhandled rejection handlers in app.js
   - Better error reporting for debugging

## How to Debug

### Run the Debug Script
```bash
cd g:\404Launcher\404Launcher
node debug-launcher.js
```

This will test:
- Config loading
- Instance list fetching
- News fetching  
- Direct URL responses

### Watch Console Logs
When running `npm run dev`, look for these debug messages:

**Normal Operation**:
```
[Launcher Not Found]: Auth data: { hasAuth: true, authName: "Elmani335", authType: "Xbox" }
[Launcher Not Found]: Instances list: { hasInstances: true, instancesLength: 1, instances: [...] }
[Launcher Not Found]: Starting minecraft-java-core Launch...
```

**Fallback Mode**:
```
[Launcher Not Found]: === USING FALLBACK INSTANCE ===
[Launcher Not Found]: This means the server is unavailable or returning invalid responses
[Launcher Not Found]: Using fallback instance due to server issues
```

**JSON Parse Errors** (now handled gracefully):
```
[Launcher Not Found]: JSON Parse Error Details: { error: "Unexpected token '<'", isHTML: true, ... }
[Launcher Not Found]: Intercepted HTML response that was about to be parsed as JSON
```

## What Was Fixed

1. **Intermittent JSON Parse Errors**: Now caught and handled gracefully
2. **Server Connectivity Issues**: Better retry logic and fallback handling
3. **minecraft-java-core HTTP Requests**: Enhanced patching to prevent problematic requests
4. **Error Visibility**: Much better debugging output to identify issues

## Testing

After running `npm run dev`:

1. **Success Case**: Game should launch normally with debug logs
2. **Server Issues**: Should gracefully fall back to offline mode
3. **Network Problems**: Should retry and provide clear error messages

The launcher should now be much more stable and provide clear feedback about what's happening during the launch process.
